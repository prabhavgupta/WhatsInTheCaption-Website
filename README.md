# WhatsInTheCaption-Website
Entry for HackData 2017

Want some intellectual Travel caption for your recent Goa photo and too lazy to go scourge the web.
Fret not , we have a solution.

What's In A Caption is one stop tool to all your caption queries.A chrome extension that analyzes the photos and provide related quotes from Tumblr and Pinterest by using OCR. It does an object recognition and uses Microsoft's computer Vision API to extrat tags from the photo. Combining the tags , it does a Word Sense Disambiguation to find the context of the tags and objects and hence provides desirable caption.

## Website
The website can also be used if the user does not want to install the chrome extension.
The user can simply paste the url into the box to get a list of captions.
